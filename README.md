1) Stored procedure was made to access data in seperate tables
2) Stored procedure was called from web api and data was returned
3) Web API MVC was made to show the data in a presentable HTML tables

Excersice 3 was done quickly as 1 + 2 took most of my time. If given more time I would have seperated the service code from the controller and created a view to
format my data in a nicer way.
